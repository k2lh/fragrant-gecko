explanation of columns to right of floorplans A-E

- **A**: layout #
- **24/30**: linear feet of contiguous countertop / linear feet of total countertop
- **14**: linear feet of usable under-countertop cabinetry

the yellow boxes are the 'continugous countertop area' while the uncolored boxes are countertop space broken into sections (ie <24" sections either side of sink)

- measurements do not include anything from the fridge wall, as this is static in all the layout versions
- countertop linear feet do not incude the sink, but do include the (induction) cooktop as usuable space
- cabinetry linear feet does not include dishwasher or sink

versions A and B compress the space by taking advantage of the height (42" work surface) to shift the (drawer) dishwasher so it's slightly under the sink, but without impinging on the drain line or disposal

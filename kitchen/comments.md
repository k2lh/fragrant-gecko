A: layout
24/30: linear feet of contiguous countertop / linear feet of total countertop
14: linear feet of cabinetry (under countertops)

measurements do not include the pantry, oven cabinet, or base cabinetry along the fridge wall 
countertop feet do not incude the sink, but do include the (induction) cooktop as usuable space
cabinetry feet does not include dishwasher or sink

versions A and B compress the space by taking advantage of the height (42" work surface) to shift the (drawer) dishwasher so it's slightly under the sink, but without impinging on the drain line or disposal
